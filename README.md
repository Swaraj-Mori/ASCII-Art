# ASCII Art

Transform any image into **ASCII art** and export it as a **dark-mode PDF** — all in pure Python.  
This project uses pixel brightness values to generate detailed ASCII visualizations that resemble the original image.

## Features
- **Dark Mode Output** — black background with white ASCII text  
- **Pixel-accurate brightness mapping** using NumPy  
- **Fully customizable** resolution, font size, and color theme  
- **Direct PDF generation** using ReportLab  
- **Lightweight and dependency-minimal**
